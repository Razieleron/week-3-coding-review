Description:

This is an exercise in arrays, branching, and loops.  The functionality is as so - the website prompts the user for a number, whereupon logic is applied to the number, and then an array whose index is dependent on the number entered by the user is returned.  There will be logic within the function that applies different strings to different numbers, depending on which digits they contain.  For example, if a number contains the digit '1', then instead of returning the number, it will return "Beep!".  So for every number that contains a 1, it will return "Beep!".  There is also logic that supercedes this function in the case of '2' and '3'.  If the digit contains a 2, then the function will return "Boop!" and if the digit returns a 3, it will return "Won't you be my neighbor?".  This poses logic gating challenges, and so for the sake of hierarchy, the number 12 will display "Boop!", 13 will display "Won't you be my neighbor?" and number 23 will display "Won't you be my neighbor?".
